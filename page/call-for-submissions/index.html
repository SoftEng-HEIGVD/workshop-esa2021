      <h1>Call for Submissions</h1>
<p>Software Assessments are used to reduce the uncertainty about the business value of a software product and the team that develops it. An assessment is usually carried out by an experienced professional by gathering and interpreting information about the software product and its development processes, comparing it to a reference model, and is usually limited in time and scope. Assessments that are too heavy will not be carried out often, therefore the challenge is to make them more efficient, where the available time is used wisely to focus on analysis that yields the most valuable insights. Assessments that focus on technical aspects only will not speak to business stakeholders, so the challenge is to enrich reference models with business value. New developments that address these challenges include business-oriented maturity/capability reference models; multi-resolution models that enable a dynamic adaptation of the assessment depth based on preliminary findings; new data-driven approaches based on the analysis of development artefacts; and tools for the automation of a collaborative and interactive assessment process.</p>
<p>ESA 2021 wants to provide a forum that connects researchers and practitioners to raise awareness about challenges, propose possible solutions and share practical experiences.</p>
<p>We are looking for contributions on the following topics (non-exclusive list):</p>
<ul>
<li>efficient, time-saving assessment methodologies</li>
<li>new maturity/capability models for development processes and software products</li>
<li>models that relate technical maturity to business value</li>
<li>multi-resolution maturity/capability models</li>
<li>data-driven analysis techniques</li>
<li>confidentiality and privacy-preserving approaches</li>
<li>tool support for automating assessments</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions should follow ICSE formatting guidelines and should be submitted through EasyChair.</p>
<p>The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2021. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.</p>
